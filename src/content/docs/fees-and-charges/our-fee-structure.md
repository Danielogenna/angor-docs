### Example Scenario

* Traditional Platform: A project raises $100,000. With a 5% platform fee and additional charges, the total cost might be $7,000, leaving $93,000 for the project.

* Angor: The same project raises $100,000. With a 2-3% fee, the total cost would be $2,000 to $3,000, leaving $97,000 to $98,000 for the project.
